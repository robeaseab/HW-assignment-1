# Kickstarter Project Analysis in Excel

For this project I organized and analyzed a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden market trends.

* Used conditional formatting based on text and value
* Used Excel formulas for a range of calculations 
* Created pivot tables to analyze the results
* Converted dates using unix timestamps
* VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP
